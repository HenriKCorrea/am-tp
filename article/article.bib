  abstract = {In the new retail era, the sales pace and consumers' consuming habits are disrupted dramatically by e-commerce and mobile consuming market developments and become various, volatile, and complicated. In sales forecasting, tree-based machine learning algorithms are popular and impressive. Feature engineering, on the other hand, is the most significant impediment to blending business and technological knowledge. An innovative way to solving the feature engineering problem of employing tree-based algorithms in sales forecast is proposed in this work. And a genetic algorithm is presented to enlarge the feature base and to explore potential values from features. To ensure that features with important business characteristics are picked, a novel feature framework for sales forecast is offered. Also given is a genetic algorithm for expanding the feature base and exploring potential values from features. The performance of tree-based models from AutoGluon will next be evaluated using a public dataset, Kaggle Rossmann sales data. The results suggest that the proposed strategy can improve the accuracy and stability of decision tree algorithms in sales forecasting significantly.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Traditional e-sales forecasting models for e-commerce platforms face challenges such as handling complex nonlinear data relationships, a lack of personalized marketing strategies, and low utilization of real-time data, resulting in poor forecasting accuracy. To address these issues, this paper explores a machine learning--based approach to sales forecasting, with the aim of improving forecast accuracy and enabling personalized marketing plans. The study uses a public dataset from an e-commerce sales forecasting challenge, performs data preprocessing, and removes outliers and missing values. An e-commerce sales forecasting model is then built using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, which can effectively capture nonlinear relationships in the data and generate more accurate sales forecasts. In addition, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to analyze customer data to support the development of personalized marketing strategies.},

  abstract = {Prediction of customer demand is an important part of Supply Chain Management, as it helps to avoid over or under production and reduces delivery time. In the context of e-commerce, accurate prediction of customer demand, typically captured by sales volume, requires careful analysis of multiple factors, namely, type of product, country of purchase, price, discount rate, free delivery option, online review sentiment etc., and their interactions. For e-tailers such as, Amazon, this kind of prediction capability is also extremely important in order to manage the supply chain efficiently as well as ensure customer satisfaction. This study investigates the efficacy of various modeling techniques, namely, regression analysis, decision-tree analysis and artificial neural network, for predicting the sales of books at amazon.in, using various relevant factors and their interactions as predictor variables. Sentiment analysis is carried out to measure the polarity of online reviews, which are included as predictors in these models. The importance of each independent predictor variable, such as discount rate, review sentiment etc., is analyzed based on the outcome of each model to determine top significant predictors which can be controlled by the marketer to influence sales. In terms of accuracy of prediction, the artificial neural network model is found to perform better than the decision-tree based model. In addition, the regression analysis, with and without sentiment and interaction factors, generates comparable results. The comparative analysis of these models reveals several significant findings. Firstly, all three models confirm that review volume is the most important and significant predictor of sales of books at amazon.in. Secondly, discount rate, discount amount and average ratings have minimal or insignificant effect on sales prediction. Thirdly, both negative sentiment and positive sentiment of the reviews are individually significant predictors as per regression and decision-tree model, but they are not significant at all as per neural network model. This observation from the neural network model is contrary to the extant research which claims that both negative and positive sentiment are significant with the former having more influence in predicting sales. Finally, the interaction effects of review volume with negative and positive sentiment are also found to be significant predictors as per all three models. Hence, overall, out of various factors used for sales prediction of books, review volume, negative sentiment, positive sentiment and their interactions are found to be the most significant ones across all models. The results of this study can be utilized by online sellers to accurately predict the sales volume by adjusting these significant factors, thereby managing the supply chain effectively.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an SFNN (a sales factor model using a neural network), which uses a back-propagation multilayer perceptron neural network and weight matrix operation, to study the mechanism of the influencing factors of online product sales in the e-commerce platform. To achieve this objective, this study analyzes the factors and relative strength of online product sales based on four aspects: online reviews, review system curation, online promotional marketing, and seller guarantees. The empirical analysis of the SFNN model based on the data of Taobao.com shows whether the 14 factors, in relation to the four aspects, have any impact on product sales. In addition, the findings indicate that the number of sentiment words greatly affects product sales. Other factors affecting online product sales significantly include the review volume, the number of uploaded pictures, the negative review rate, the discount rate, 7+day returns and money-back guarantees, and the freight insurance. This study examines the interactions among the various factors affecting product sales on the e-commerce platform and provides management inspiration for e-commerce enterprises to manipulate online reviews, undertake effective promotion and fulfill after-sales promises.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting customer purchase intent is vital for achieving success in the e-commerce environment. While machine learning provides advanced solutions, the effectiveness of predictive models largely depends on the quality of the selected features. This study explores the impact of three feature selection methods---Information Gain, Chi-Square, and Fisher Discriminant Ratio---by utilizing real-world clickstream data to predict purchasing behavior. Our analysis reveals that the choice of selection method significantly affects the identification of key features. In particular, the Chi-Square method proved to be the most effective in minimizing class overlap, allowing for clearer differentiation between sessions that ended in a purchase and those that did not. Additionally, features associated with historical purchase probability and temporal attributes consistently demonstrated high discriminatory power. This study underscores the importance of effective feature engineering as a fundamental strategy for generating insightful predictions and enhancing model performance in understanding online consumer behavior.},

  abstract = {Tree-based machine learning models such as random forests, decision trees and gradient boosted trees are popular nonlinear predictive models, yet comparatively little attention has been paid to explaining their predictions. Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.}
