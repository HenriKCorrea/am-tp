Practical Activity 5: Data Preprocessing

In this practical activity, students (organized into practical work groups) must submit a brief report (up to 2 pages) describing:

(i) the data chosen for the practical project in terms of its main characteristics (size, dimensionality, attribute types, distribution of instances by class or of the numerical target attribute, attribute distribution, etc.),
(ii) the problems already identified in the data through exploratory analysis, and 
(iii) the strategies they envision applying (or have already applied) to address the problems mentioned in data preprocessing. 
Finally, students are also expected to briefly describe the strategies they intend to use to train and evaluate the models (such as algorithms, data division strategies, evaluation metrics, etc.).

There is no pre-established format. The report must be clearly identified with the group name and must be submitted via the link below in PDF format.

DEADLINE: 10/05/2024, at 11:59 pm.
